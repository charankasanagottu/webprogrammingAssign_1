        Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness 
        to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        About 1,200 Russian soldiers were being killed or wounded every day in May and June, 
        the highest rate since the beginning of the war, according to Western officials.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In response, Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of the city of Pokrovsk, 
        with a local military official telling residents that Russian forces were "rapidly approaching".
