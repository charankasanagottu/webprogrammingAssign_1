            Ukraine sends units into Russia
        </h3>
    <p>
        Ukrainian troops launched a surprise attack across the border in early August, 
        advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region of Kursk.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the 
        Russian government and President Vladimir Putin condemned 
        the Ukrainian offensive as a "major provocation".
    </p><br>
    <p>
        After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq 
        km of Russian territory and 93 villages. 
        The regions of Kursk and Belgorod have both declared a state of emergency.
